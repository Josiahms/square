Welcome to the bottom of the city.  Here you can't even see the sky, let alone enjoy the weather.  Some days the smog is so thick you can hardly tell if it's night or day.  We, the people down here, can do nothing for our own gain and toil only for the benefit of our masters.  Our fathers traded their freedom and privacy for the conviniences of technology.  That same technology was used to control them, and eventually us.
Advanced identification technology tracks our every move, brutal security implementations make it impossible for any of us to deviate from the path chosen for us.  It would be easier, if it weren't for gravity holding us down.  Only those deemed qualified are allowed to ascend.  But we've found another way!
Take this exo-suit.  With it you will be able to climb walls, jump extreme heights, and change your direction mid flight!  Use it to ascend and crumble the tyranny at the highest levels of this city!
